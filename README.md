🧠 YOLO-Based Garbage Classification System
(AI Model for Smart Waste Categorization)

This project implements a high-accuracy Deep Learning-based garbage classification system using YOLOv8 image classification.
The model is trained on a custom dataset containing various waste categories such as battery, biological, cardboard, clothes, glass, metal, paper, plastic, shoes, and general trash.
The purpose of this AI model is to enable intelligent systems to automatically detect and categorize waste materials, forming the core vision component of a larger smart-cleaning or smart-sorting system.


🎯 Project Description

This work focuses on designing and developing a robust AI-based garbage classification model using YOLOv8.
The model learns to identify different types of waste materials through labeled image data and provides highly accurate predictions suitable for:

Waste sorting automation

Smart city waste management

Pre-sorting for recycling plants

AIoT waste detection modules

Research projects involving computer vision and environmental automation

The system uses YOLOv8 Large Classification (YOLOv8-cls) architecture to achieve excellent accuracy on diverse garbage categories.

🚀 Key Capabilities

✔️ Classifies waste into 10 categories

✔️ High accuracy using YOLOv8-cls

✔️ Clean and organized dataset structure

✔️ Fast training and inference

✔️ Plug-and-play for Google Colab

✔️ Suitable for real-time AIoT and automation projects

⭐ Summary

This project delivers a powerful, flexible, and accurate AI-based garbage classification system that can be integrated into any smart automation or research solution where intelligent waste identification is required.
